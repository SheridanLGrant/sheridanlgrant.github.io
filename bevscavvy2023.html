                        In Brief
                    </h3>

                    Read The Deets, below, before playing.

                    <ul>
                        <li>Teams of 3. You can deviate from this if you wish, but you won't be eligible for prizes.</li>
                        <li>12 clues spread around Seattle's Lake Union.</li>
                        <li>No cars, no bikes, no scooters--you must take public transit or walk everywhere. We recommend buying a $8 "regional day pass" for your Orca card or Transit Go app, which will cover both bus and Link fares.</li>
                        <li>To officially complete the scavvy, each team must also take a shot at 3 bars and consume a 6-pack of an alcoholic beverage. You can always skip this or drink less--but you won't be eligible for prizes!</li>
                        <li><b>Important:</b> have your team captain download <a href="https://signal.org/en/">Signal</a> and make an account, and then register your team via <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScPideQqDPFunCwAWoNCJV_FCxUMXnVY2lseaf_9xe3oCxU7Q/viewform?usp=sf_link">this Google Form</a>. The captain will join a Signal group so that we can communicate updates and hints to your team, and so that we can verify that you have solved clues.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>
                        Why Scav?
                    </h3>

                    The Beverage Scavenger Hunt is a tradition as old as time, one that even predates the era in which Sheridan could grow a full beard (okay, admittedly, that was like, 5 years ago). In its original form, teams of 3 needed to complete a 20-item scavenger hunt and drink a 24-pack of beer to finish--which only a foolish few did. Our contest is adapted for the modern era, in which we old farts can't drink like we used to, in which scavvyers should be able to complete the hunt while staying (however narrowly) within the bounds of the law, and in which <i>we can assume no legal or medical responsibility for any of this shit</i>.
                    <br><br>
                    Bev Scavvy is fun even if you don't drink alcohol, or don't/can't finish the drinking component, or don't complete all the clues because you got drunkenly distracted by your teammate's relationship drama. Sheridan never actually finished either of the two college bev scavvies he competed in, for the latter two reasons. However, if you <i>really</i> care about the destination more than the journey, you will need to complete both the scavvying and drinking components to be eligible for prizes--we owe our bev scavvy forebears this much.

                    <h3>
                        The Deets
                    </h3>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Your team captain must know Sheridan or Diya. We gotta keep a bit of a lid on this.</li>
                        <li>Your team must assemble at the starting location (Sheridan and Diya's house) before the Scavvy starts at 6pm (but after 5:30).</li>
                        <li>Your team captain must have the Signal app on their phone and be a member of the Bev Scavvy 2023 Signal group. You should probably make sure someone else has Sheridan or Diya's number, in case the captain's phone gets lost or broken.</li>
                        <li>
                            To complete the scav, your team must meet the following criteria:

                            <ul>
                                <li>Arrive back at 2925 2nd Ave N with your <i>whole team</i>. All teams arriving at the finish before 9:30pm will tie for first, to encourage everyone to enjoy the hunt and not push it too hard.</li>
                                <li>All clues provably solved (each clue will describe how to complete itself).</li>
                                <li>You must pick 3 different bars in 3 of the following 4 neighborhoods: Fremont, U District, Capitol Hill, SLU/Belltown/Lower Queen Anne. Your <i>whole team</i> must take a shot together at each bar, and send a selfie-video of each shot-taking to the Signal <b>group</b> along with the name of the fine establishment you are patronizing.</li>
                                <li>You must obtain a 6-pack of a WA-based alcoholic beverage (at least 3% ABV) and finish it--not necessarily evenly split among your team. Bring the empties. Please do not do this on the street, on the bus/Link, or anywhere else that would be rude. We recommend a picnic table in a park!</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>The (currently hidden) clues will impose an additional cost of ~$30-60 <i>per team</i>--depending on if you save room for dinner or just dessert--which will support the Seattle restaurant industry, the prizes, and (least of all) the organizers. Of course, you can always skip these clues (and as much of the drinking as you want) if you want to scav on the cheap.</li>
                        <li>We suggest you bring: backpack (1-2 per team), snacks, plenty of water, cell phone, external battery (1 per team), Orca card/Transit Go pass on phone, sensible shoes, warm clothes.</li>
                        <li>Additional drinking is not required, but <i>is</i> strongly encouraged.</li>
                        <li>Completely unrelated to the previous bullet: the organizers do not take responsibility for your drunk (or sober) ass. Know your limits, drink plenty of water, and only do <i>fun</i> stupid drunk things, not <i>dangerous</i> stupid drunk things.</li>
                    </ul>
