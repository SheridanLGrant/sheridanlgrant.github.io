                        The Beverage Scavenger Hunt is a tradition as old as time, one that even predates the era in which Sheridan could grow a full beard. In its original form, teams of 3 needed to complete a 20-item scavenger hunt and drink a 24-pack of beer to finish--which only a foolish few did. Our contest is adapted for the modern era, in which we old farts can't drink like we used to, in which scavvyers should be able to complete the hunt while staying (however narrowly) within the bounds of the law, and in which <i>we can assume no legal or medical responsibility for any of this shit</i>.
                        <br><br>
                        Bev Scavvy is fun even if you don't drink alcohol, or don't/can't finish the drinking component, or don't complete all the clues because you got drunkenly distracted by your teammate's relationship drama. Sheridan never actually finished either of the two bev scavvies he competed in, for the latter two reasons. However, if you <i>really</i> care about the destination more than the journey, you will need to complete both the scavvying and drinking components to be eligible for prizes--we owe our bev scavvy forebears this much.
