                    </h2>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Snap a team selfie with Seattle's O.G. rock star. Have your team captain send it to Sheridan in a Signal direct message (DM).</li>
                        <!-- <li>Score a drink from a vending machine (it goes without saying that someone must chug it immediately). Send a video of the successful vend and chug to the Signal <b>group</b>.</li> -->
                        <!-- <li>This Seattle cephalopod has moved just down the block, but we'll never forget where it all began. Take a video of one of your teammates singing the Beatles song in front of this institution's original location.</li> -->
                        <li>Play a round of pinball. Send a pic of your team with their (hopefully, but not necessarily, high) score to the Signal <b>group</b>.</li>
                        <li>This Seattleite has blood on his hand--but no matter your party, you've gotta take a team selfie with him and have your captain Signal DM it to Sheridan!</li>
                        <li><b>TIME SENSITIVE--must be finished by 9pm:</b> customers are encouraged to get high in this iconic hub for Seattle streetwear--65 feet high, to be exact. Hit the dressing rooms to trick out your crunchiest teammate and Signal DM Sheridan a practical but stylin' photo of them. Best outfit will win a prize, regardless of whether your tean finishes!</li>
                        <li>Scavvers, sate yourselves with something scrumptious! Not just any food will do, though--you must eat (or get takeout) from somewhere with exactly 4.5 stars on Yelp. If some of your team already ate or has onerous dietary restrictions, worry not--just spend $20 or more, and have your captain send the Signal <b>group</b> a picture/screenshot of the receipt, and link to/screenshot of the Yelp page.</li>
                        <li>You are what you eat! Cyclists breeze by this rare herbivore, but you won't. Take a picture of two of your teammates grazing alongside it, and have your captain Signal DM it to Sheridan.</li>
                        <li>Where once there was death, one might now find Irish Death; where once dwelt the Holy Spirit, there now dwells Holy Mountain. Takest thou a selfie on its steppes and DMest thou it verily to Sheridan on Signal via thy captain.</li>
                        <li>This pillar of Seattle industry leaves his massive stones on display for all to contemplate and caress. Your captain will Signal DM Sheridan a picture of your team doing so.</li>
                        <li>Wander ye where Penix throws<br>Or young Isaiah Thomas rose<br>Not far from where the Link slows<br>In watchful gaze our boy is froze<br>Now to honor thy body through yoga flows<br>Strikest thou his namesake pose<br>(then Signal DMest thou a photo of that shit to Sheridan)</li>
                        <li>From the previous clue, follow a ramp, then duck where others sit; 'side the pool where a ramp takes ducks to shit. Then Signal DM Sheridan the four main vocalizations of the North American Sasquatch.</li>
                        <li>Maybe you can't find your inner Dawg--but that's okay, in Seattle, there are Dawgs everywhere! Find one and take a selfie with them (with their knowledge and consent, of course) and their student ID (they may cover up their name/photo if they wish) for proof. Have your team captain send the selfie to the Signal <b>group</b>. You may not knowingly share the same Dawg with another team.</li>
                        <li>Oh shit--we forgot to buy prizes for bev scavvy! Fortunately, you can help. Buy a 22oz or 750ml bottle of wine, cider, or beer that was made in WA and bring it with you to the finish.</li>
