                    The main prize goes to all teams arriving at the finish location before 8:30pm. There are also three secondary prizes! Clues 5, 10, and 11 each afford you an opportunity to earn "points," and the team with the most points wins a prize---regardless of whether they completed all clues successfully. Clues 4 and 12 are photo contests, to be soberly and impartially judged by the Committee at 9pm <i>sharp</i>, whose winners will each also win a prize.

                        <li>You probably won't find another 45lb catfish, but there should be plenty of interesting microörganisms in the water sample you bring us from the Emerald City's shittiest lake. Hope you remembered your water bottle (or other container)!</li>
                        <!-- <li>If this artist were upset, he might say "blow me." Peep his art through the hedge.</li> -->
