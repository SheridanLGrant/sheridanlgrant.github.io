                    <h3>Prizes</h3>
                    
                    <p>The main prize goes to all teams arriving at the finish location before 8:30pm. There are also three secondary prizes! Clues 5, 10, and 11 each afford you an opportunity to earn "points," and the team with the most points wins a prize---regardless of whether they completed all clues successfully. Clues 4 and 12 are photo contests, to be soberly and impartially judged by the Committee at 9pm <i>sharp</i>, whose winners will each also win a prize.</p>

                    <p>Each clue requires physical or digital proof of solution. Unless the clue says otherwise, bring your proof to the finish for verification.</p>

                    <h3>Clues</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Where patrons pad softly but pack big paddles, play a point and pick a proof page from paddles' pips' proximity.</li>
                        <li>Buy a tale with a worn spine where tails are pet and spines are arched.</li>
                        <!-- <li>If this artist were upset, he might say "blow me." Peep his art through the hedge.</li> -->
                        <!-- <li>Take a cue from Mr. Worldwide and show some love to this water fixture by taking a lap. Tell us if it's on or off.</li> -->
                        <li>These immobile commuters have been waiting 85 years for the next streetcar. Cheer them up by donning them in an article of clothing. Provide picture proof!</li>
                        <li>This local Fortune 500 establishment's founder came to Seattle in search of gold, but got rich off drip instead. Send your most stylish teammate to the dressing rooms and send the Signal group a photo. Best photo wins a prize!</li>
                        <li>The best scavvers embrace risk. Share a meal with your team, earning the following points based on the food safety rating of the establishment you patronize: Excellent = 1, Good = 2, Okay = 3, Needs to Improve = 5. Bring a $20+ receipt for proof. There is <b>no need</b> to take a photo of the restaurant's food safety rating, as it can be verified online.</li>
                        <li>How many bikes went across the Fremont Bridge so far today? Provide picture proof!</li>
                        <li>Take the one true path to (or from) the center of Seattle, the single greatest way to travel. Avoid licking any interior fixtures during your ride so as to not contract the Epstein-Barr virus.</li>
                        <li>It's surprisingly easy to find in a haystack and can withstand a 9.0 earthquake---but can it withstand the gentle caress of a teammate's tongue? Provide picture proof!</li>
                        <li>You probably won't find another 45lb catfish, but there should be plenty of interesting microörganisms in the water sample you bring us from the Emerald City's shittiest lake. Hope you remembered your water bottle (or other container)!</li>
                        <li>Seattleites love to eat a bag of this. Bring a receipt from at least one---but earn a point for each receipt from a unique location you bring.</li>
                        <li>Graffiti is welcome at the cold half of a Cold Snack. Write your team's initials on an interior wall, and earn a bonus point for slappin' a single sticker up there too. Provide picture proof!</li>
                        <li>Find your döggelganger on the streets of Seattle, and take a photo of one teammate with them---on all fours, of course. Best photo wins a prize!</li>
                        <li>Pull up primed to pound at the post-puzzle party with a prime-proof pack of previously Prohibited potable potions. Four- or six-packs are acceptable, and we'll round the proof to an integer to determine whether you solved the clue.</li><!--For example, Keystone Light at 4.1% ABV qualifies-->
