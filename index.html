    <h2 class="featurette-heading">About Me</h2>
    <p class="lead">
I’ll be graduating and on the job market next year! I’m interested in research positions focused on social science applications, as well as teaching-oriented academic jobs. Contact me if you think I’d be a good fit.
<br/>
I’m from Huntsville, Texas, home of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Tribute_to_Courage">67-foot Sam Houston statue</a> and <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/ppm75v/what-happens-when-you-build-a-town-around-a-prison">7 different prisons</a>! I went to <a href="https://www.pomona.edu/academics/departments/mathematics">Pomona College</a>, studying math, stats, and CS. After undergrad, I spent a year modeling energy systems and carbon emissions at <a href="https://www.ethree.com">Energy and Environmental Economics</a> in San Francisco, before moving to Seattle to start my PhD at the UW. I’m an amateur cross-country, track, and trail runner with <a href="https://www.clubnorthwest.org/">Club Northwest</a> (I’m on the board, too!), I backpack all over the world, and I play the piano. I’m also a sucker for a good happy hour ;).
