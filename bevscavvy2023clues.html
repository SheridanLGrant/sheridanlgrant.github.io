                    <ul>
                        <li>Snap a team selfie with Seattle's O.G. rock star. Have your team captain send it to Sheridan in a Signal direct message (DM).</li>
                        <li>Score a drink from a vending machine (it goes without saying that someone must chug it immediately). Send a video of the successful vend and chug to the Signal <b>group</b>.</li>
                        <li>This pillar of Seattle industry leaves his massive stones on display for all to contemplate and caress. Your captain will Signal DM Sheridan a picture of your team doing so.</li>
                        <li>Play a round of pinball. Send a pic of your team with their (hopefully, but not necessarily, high) score to the Signal <b>group</b>.</li>
                        <li>This Seattleite has blood on his hand--but no matter your party affiliation, you've gotta take a team selfie with him and have your captain Signal DM it to Sheridan!</li>
                        <li>Scavvers, sate yourselves with something scrumptious! Not just any food will do, though--you must eat (or get takeout) from somewhere with exactly 4.5 stars on Yelp. If some of your team already ate or has onerous dietary restrictions, worry not--just spend $20 or more, and have your captain send the Signal <b>group</b> a picture/screenshot of the receipt, and a screenshot of the Yelp page.</li>
                        <li>Where once there was death, one might now find Irish Death; where once dwelt the Holy Spirit, there now dwells Holy Mountain. Takest thou a selfie on mine steppes and DMest it thou to Sheridan on Signal via thy captain.</li>
                        <li>Everyone's got that Dawg in 'em, but it can be hard to find at times. Have your captain send Sheridan a Signal DM that describes what is bundled to the grundle of UW Basketball's bronze mascot.</li>
                        <li>Maybe you can't find your inner Dawg--but that's okay, in Seattle, there are Dawgs everywhere! Find one and take a selfie with them (with their knowledge and consent, of course) and their student ID for proof. Have your team captain send the selfie to the Signal <b>group</b>. You may not share the same Dawg with another team.</li>
                        <li>We forgot to buy prizes for the top finishers! Fortunately, you can help. Buy a 22oz or 750ml bottle of beer made by a WA brewery and bring it with you to the finish.</li>
