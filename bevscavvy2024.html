                    <h3>
                        Ye Olde Summary
                    </h3>

                    In days of yesteryear, scav comp'nies doth did imbibe four-and-twenty ales, rendering ye completion of ye scavvy nigh impossible. In presente day, ye olde Drinking Quota hath been reduced to accommodate thy friendes who can'st consume thine weight in ale, ande to becurb ye olde risk of mortal woundes. Ye principal concernes doth be:

                    <ul>
                        <li>Teams of 3.</li>
                        <li>10 clues spread around Lake Union.</li>
                        <li>No cars, no bikes, no scooters--you must take public transit or walk everywhere. We recommend buying a $8 "regional day pass" for your Orca card or Transit Go app, which will cover both bus and Link fares.</li>
                        <li>Team must take a shot at each of 3 bars and consume a 6-pack of an alcoholic beverage.</li>
                        <li>No one will actually be enforcing any of these rules.</li>
                        <li>Your team captain must download <a href="https://signal.org/">Signal</a> and make an account, and then <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdM3zgtKtRWRuq-2KMv5W2JyXmwdme9YLVnbOz-vwCXPqZKHg/viewform?usp=sf_link">register your team</a> (if you're not the captain, you can still say you're going on <a href="https://partiful.com/e/usmUoaYai5I4q2HMLqX4">Partiful</a>). The captain will join a Signal group where the mods can communicate updates, hints, and clarifications to your team.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>
                        In Detaile
                    </h3>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Your team must assemble at the starting location (Ronan's house) before the Scavvy starts at 5pm (but after 4:30).</li>
                        <li>Your team captain must have the Signal app on their phone and be a member of the Bev Scavvy 2024 Signal group. You should probably make sure someone else on the team has a mod's phone number in case the captain's phone dies.</li>
                        <li>
                            To complete the scav, your team must meet the following criteria:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Arrive back at 424 NE 73rd St with your <i>whole team</i>.</li>
                                <li>Proof of all clues solved (the clue sheet will explain how to provide proof). All clues except one will lie unambiguously within one of these four neighborhoods: Fremont, Lower Queen Anne, Capitol Hill, and Green Lake/Roosevelt. The remaining clue lies within a five-minute walk of the Westlake light rail station.</li>
                                <li>You must pick 3 different bars in 3 of the aforementioned 4 neighborhoods. Your team must take a shot together at each bar, and send a selfie-video of each shot-taking to the Signal group along with the name of the fine establishment you are patronizing.</li>
                                <li>You must obtain a 6-pack of a Washington-based alcoholic beverage and finish it--not necessarily evenly split among your team. Bring the empties to the finish. Please do not do this on the street, on the bus/Link, or anywhere else that would be rude. We recommend a picnic table in a park!</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>The clues will impose a cost of ~$10-20 <i>per person</i>---depending on if you save room for dinner or just dessert---which will support the Seattle restaurant industry and the afterparty. You can always skip these clues (and as much of the drinking as you want) if you want to scav on the cheap---you just won't be eligible for the prize, the least important part of the scav.</li>
                        <li>Each team should bring along a clothing accessory that they wouldn't mind parting with.</li>
                        <li>We suggest you bring: backpack (1-2 per team), snacks, plenty of water, cell phone, external battery, Orca card/Transit Go pass on phone, sensible shoes, warm clothes, rain jacket.</li>
                        <li>Additional drinking is not required, but <i>is</i> strongly encouraged.</li>
                        <li>HOWEVER: we do not take responsibility for your drunk (or sober) ass. Know your limits, drink plenty of water, and---most importantly---don't get the organizers in trouble.</li>
                    </ul>
