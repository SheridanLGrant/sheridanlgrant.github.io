                        Ye Olde Summary
                    </h3>

                    In days of yesteryear, scav comp'nies doth did imbibe four-and-twenty ales, rendering ye completion of ye scavvy nigh impossible. In presente day, ye olde Drinking Quota hath been reduced to accommodate thy friendes who can'st consume thine weight in ale, ande to becurb ye olde risk of mortal woundes.

                    In Shorte
                    <ul>
                        <li>Teams of 3.</li>
                        <li>10 clues spread around Lake Union.</li>
                        <li>No cars, no bikes, no scooters--you must take public transit or walk everywhere. We recommend buying a $8 "regional day pass" for your Orca card or Transit Go app, which will cover both bus and Link fares.</li>
                        <li>Team must take a shot at 3 bars and consume a 6-pack of an alcoholic beverage.</li>
                        <li>No one will actually be enforcing any of these rules.</li>
                        <li><b>Important:</b> have your team captain download <a href="https://signal.org/">Signal</a> and make an account, and then register your team via <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdM3zgtKtRWRuq-2KMv5W2JyXmwdme9YLVnbOz-vwCXPqZKHg/viewform?usp=sf_link">this Google Form</a>. The captain will join a Signal group so that we can communicate updates, hints, and clarifications to your team.</li>
                    </ul>.

                    <h3>
                        In Detaile
                    </h3>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Your team must assemble at the starting location (Ronan's house) before the Scavvy starts at 5pm (but after 5:30).</li>
                        <li>Your team captain must have the Signal app on their phone and be a member of the Bev Scavvy 2024 Signal group. You should probably make sure someone else on the team has an admin's phone number in case the captain's phone dies.</li>
                        <li>
                            To complete the scav, your team must meet the following criteria:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Arrive back at 424 NE 73rd St with your <i>whole team</i>. All teams arriving at the finish before 8:30pm will tie for first place.</li>
                                <li>All clues solved (each clue will describe how to prove you solved it).</li>
                                <li>You must pick 3 different bars in 3 of the following 4 neighborhoods: Fremont, Lower Queen Anne, Capitol Hill, Green Lake/Roosevelt. Your team must take a shot together at each bar, and send a selfie-video of each shot-taking to the Signal <b>group</b> along with the name of the fine establishment you are patronizing.</li>
                                <li>You must obtain a 6-pack of a Washington-based alcoholic beverage (at least 3% ABV) and finish it--not necessarily evenly split among your team. Bring the empties. Please do not do this on the street, on the bus/Link, or anywhere else that would be rude. We recommend a picnic table in a park!</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>The (currently hidden) clues will impose an additional cost of ~$30-60 <i>per team</i>--depending on if you save room for dinner or just dessert--which will support the Seattle restaurant industry, the prizes, and (least of all) the organizers. You can always skip these clues (and as much of the drinking as you want) if you want to scav on the cheap.</li>
                        <li>We suggest you bring: backpack (1-2 per team), snacks, plenty of water, cell phone, external battery (1 per team), Orca card/Transit Go pass on phone, sensible shoes, warm clothes, rain jacket.</li>
                        <li>Additional drinking is not required, but <i>is</i> strongly encouraged.</li>
                        <li>Completely unrelated to the previous bullet: the organizers do not take responsibility for your drunk (or sober) ass. Know your limits, drink plenty of water, and only do <i>fun</i> stupid drunk things, not <i>dangerous</i> stupid drunk things.</li>
                    </ul>
